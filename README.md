# TicTacToe-Python
TicTacToe in Python Programming Language! with new rules!

This is a two-player game of TicTacToe where players can adjust the size of the board!

1. Each player will take turns to put the symbol in the correct tiles!
2. Every turn, players must each put two adjacent symbols into the board.
3. The winner is the one with the most tiles when the game ends (no adjacent tiles to be inserted with the symbol).
4. It will be a draw if no adjacent tiles to be inserted with the symbol but both players have the same number of symbols.
5. Enjoy!
